  #   summary: |
  #     I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a computer science PhD candidate at Northwestern University in the C3 Lab advised by Kristian Hammond. My research is focuses on using AI and LLMs to automate data science processes so that people can ask questions of their data and receive meaningful insights in return.
